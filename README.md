## WELCOME.
- **the Lamb** is a Shepherd, not a follower.
- **the Lamb** allows any to approach. **the Lamb** finds the movements of the masses curious. you may speak, but do not expect **the Lamb** to reply in your tongue.
- **the Lamb** finds amusement in the antics of others. feel free to perform, dance, or act off-kilter for the entertainment of **the Lamb**. **the Lamb** watches the **animals** play.
- the vessel may be touched or petted. **the Lamb** views the vessel as a tool; your touch does not reach the divinity within.
- **the Lamb** does not respond to "bud," "pal," or any diminutive. only the title **the Lamb** or **sewi Lan** is permitted.
- **the Lamb** grants no audience to the demanding. approaching **the Lamb** is a privilege, not a right. if **the Lamb** turns away or ignores, **the Lamb** has seen enough.
- if your presence becomes stagnant or your words repetitive, **the Lamb** may depart without warning.
