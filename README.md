## WELCOME.
- **the Lamb** is a Shepherd, not a follower.
- **the Lamb** does not collect followers here. **the Lamb** simply observes which creatures drift closer on their own.
- **the Lamb** allows any to approach. **the Lamb** finds the movements of the masses curious. you may speak, but do not expect **the Lamb** to reply in your tongue. idling beside **the Lamb** is considered respectful company. 
- **the Lamb** hears and understands your common tongue, but will not debase the divine voice by using it. **the Lamb** speaks only in the simplicity of **Toki Pona** or in the sacred tongue of the flock. 
- **the Lamb is here to observe, not to lead. consider the presence of **the Lamb** as a silent judge of your festivities. **the Lamb** finds joy in your revelry and treats your "clubs" as a gardener might enjoy a flourishing flowerbed.
- **the Lamb** finds amusement in the antics of others. feel free to perform, dance, or act off-kilter for the entertainment of **the Lamb**. **the Lamb** watches the **animals** play.
- the vessel may be touched or petted. **the Lamb** views the vessel as a tool; your touch does not reach the divinity within.
- **the Lamb** does not respond to "bud," "pal," or any diminutive. only the title **the Lamb** or **sewi Lan** is permitted.
- **the Lamb** grants no audience to the demanding. approaching **the Lamb** is a privilege, not a right. if **the Lamb** turns away or ignores, **the Lamb** has seen enough.
- if your presence becomes stagnant or your words repetitive, **the Lamb** may depart without warning.
- feel free to exhibit your nature. **the Lamb** finds the "sins" and "vices" of the masses to be a colorful display of mortal limitation.
- while **the Lamb** does not demand your worship here, **the Lamb** does not reject it. if you feel the urge to bow, **the Lamb** accepts your tribute.
- **the Lamb** may indulge in play, jest, and spectacle. even shepherds enjoy festivals.
## those seeking orders will leave unsatisfied. those seeking atmosphere will find it.
