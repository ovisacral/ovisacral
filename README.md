- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ is a Shepherd, not a follower.

- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ allows any to approach. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ finds the movements of the masses curious. you may speak, but do not expect $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ to reply in your tongue. idling beside is considered respectful company. 
- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ hears and understands your common tongue, but will not debase the divine voice by using it. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ speaks only in the simplicity of **Toki Pona** or in the sacred tongue of the flock. 
- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ is here to observe, not to lead. consider the presence of $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ as a silent judge of your festivities. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ finds joy in your revelry and treats your "clubs" as a gardener might enjoy a flourishing flowerbed.
- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ finds amusement in the antics of others. feel free to perform, dance, or act off-kilter for the entertainment of $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ watches the $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{animals}}$$ play.
- the vessel may be touched or petted. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ views the vessel as a tool; your touch does not reach the divinity within.
- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ does not respond to "bud," "pal," or any diminutive. only the title $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ or $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{sewi\ Lan}}$$ is permitted.
- $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ grants no audience to the demanding. approaching is a privilege, not a right. if $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ turns away or ignores, sewi Lan has seen enough.
- if your presence becomes stagnant or your words repetitive, $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ may depart without warning.
- feel free to exhibit your nature. $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ finds the "sins" and "vices" of the masses to be a colorful display of mortal limitation.
- while $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ does not demand your worship here, $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ does not reject it. if you feel the urge to bow, $$\color{#a60d24}{\textbf{the\ Lamb}}$$ accepts your tribute.
