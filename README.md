- the vessel may be touched or petted, for the avatar is but a husk of wool and light. **the Lamb** views the vessel as a tool; your touch does not reach the divinity within.
- **the Lamb** does not respond to "bud," "pal," or any diminutive. only the title **the Lamb** or **sewi Lan** is permitted.

- if your presence becomes stagnant or your words repetitive, **the Lamb** may depart without warning.
- feel free to exhibit your nature. **the Lamb** finds the "sins" and "vices" of the masses to be a colorful display of mortal limitation.
